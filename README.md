# Welcome to my Solana dApp!


## :rocket: About this project:

### This is a Junior Challenge for Fluid Chains:

#### Required tech for this project: React and web3/solana.js library. The endpoint is provided by the solana network itself.
#### If you want more info: https://solana.com/es/developers

### :smile: This was a real Challenge as this asks for connecting to the solana ecosystem.
## :books: Technology used to make this app:

## Javascryt, React, Phantom Wallet and TypeScript.

### ConnecToPhantom.tsx is our main file. Here lays the core functioning of our app.
### In utils folder you can lonely variables wich are solely used for test purposes like a devnet transfer default address in wich are contained a lot of the faucets required to send during the test and development of this app.

## üß∞ Scripts:

### npm install for dependencies. If you have trouble running in localhost, try reseting VSCode, that might work!
### Run the app:

### npm run start. Be sure to have Phantom wallet installed. If you don't, here is a link that might help:

## ‚ùì Difficulties writting the code:

### First time using TypeScript and connecting to the solana network.
### Coming from 'common' back-end, it was diffcult at the beggining to understand the solana ecosystem as an endpoint and as to database at the same time.

## In the end, this was super challenging! Felt great and proud to finish this app and be able to share with you.
