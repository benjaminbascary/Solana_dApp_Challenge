## npm install. Be sure to have Phantom Wallet extension installed on your browser.
# download: https://phantom.app/download

## Installed: solana/web3.js, react-error-overlay and typescript.

## Downgraded to react-scripts @4.0.3 due to various unknown react/client-side errors.
## (added 
##      "preinstall": "npx npm-force-resolutions" 
##      "resolutions": { "react-error-overlay": "6.0.9" },
##  to scripts for same reasons above.)

## Working on History.tsx component.. trying to figure out how to surpass buffer bug in client.
## it won't let me show the history by more than 2 seconds.

## The app needs a Dependency Injection Container for better code maintenance and clean structure.
